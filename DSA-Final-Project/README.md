With our custom-made campus guide, you'll always find your way, whether it's to the cafeteria, the lecture halls, or that secret chai spot!

## 📜 Project Overview

This ain't your grandma's old paper map! 🚀 It's a high-tech, brainy tracker designed with:

- **Graphs** for smart campus mapping. 📈
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to get you there faster than your snack cravings. 🍔
- **AVL Trees** for ultra-sorted locations (a nerd's paradise!). 🌳
- **Linked Lists** to stalk—uh, track—your every step. 👣
- **Queues and Stacks** to bookmark faves and relive your history. 📚

## 🧠 Why Did We Do This?

- Because getting lost is so last century. 😌
- Because walking in circles isn't cardio. 🏃‍♂️
